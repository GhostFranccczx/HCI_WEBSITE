                    I am a 20-year-old chill photographer in town. I love capturing moments and creating memories through my lens. My passion for photography started at a young age, and it has only grown stronger over the years. I believe that every picture tells a story, and I strive to tell those stories through my work. My love for photography grew when I met a beautiful lady who became the inspiration for each of my works. I love taking pictures of nature and portraits of her.

                    I began my education at Legarda Elementary School, where I completed my elementary years. For junior high school, I attended Ramon Magsaysay High School, continuing to build my academic foundation. I then pursued my senior high school education at Eastern Pangasinan Agricultural College, where I further developed my skills and interests. Currently, I am enrolled at the University of Eastern Pangasinan, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, as I work towards achieving my career goals.

                    I am a chill person who loves to take things easy. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, and I value the relationships I have with them. I am also a creative individual who loves to express myself through my photography. I believe that life is too short to take too seriously, and I try to live each day to the fullest. I am a chill person who loves to play games and enjoys my life to the fullest. I am a joyful man, who loves to crack jokes with strangers and make them my friends

                    For the past two years, I have been proudly serving as the official photographer for our church here in our barangay. My work has been consistently recognized, with several of my shots featured on our churchâ€™s official page. Beyond church events, I also assist a fellow photographer as his trusted righthand man, capturing creative and dynamic shots at various occasions. Through these experiences, I have honed my skills, built a strong eye for detail, and developed a deep passion for telling powerful stories through photography.
